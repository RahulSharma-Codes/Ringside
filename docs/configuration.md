# Ringside — Configuration Reference

All environment variables read by the API server, backup worker, and shared DB library
are documented here. This file is generated from a static scan of `process.env` references
across `artifacts/api-server/src/`, `artifacts/backup-worker/src/`, and `lib/db/src/`.

Set them in **Replit Secrets** for production deployments, or in a local `.env.local`
file for development (copy `.env.example` as a starting point — never commit `.env` files).

---

## API Server (`artifacts/api-server`)

### Required — always

| Variable | Description | Behaviour when unset |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | TCP port the server listens on. | Server refuses to boot — throws `"PORT environment variable is required"`. |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | HMAC secret used to sign JWTs. **Must be ≥ 32 characters of random data.** | Server refuses to boot — auth middleware rejects the short secret. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. |

### Database connection

The DB layer (`lib/db`) prefers the explicit Postgres variables over `DATABASE_URL`.
Both paths are supported; `PG*` variables take precedence when `PGHOST` is set.

| Variable | Required | Description | Behaviour when unset |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PGHOST` | ✅ (preferred) | Postgres hostname. Auto-set by Replit Postgres. | Falls back to `DATABASE_URL` if set; otherwise connection fails at startup. |
| `PGUSER` | ✅ (preferred) | Postgres username. Auto-set by Replit Postgres. | Same fallback as above. |
| `PGPASSWORD` | ✅ (preferred) | Postgres password. Auto-set by Replit Postgres. | Same fallback as above. |
| `PGDATABASE` | ✅ (preferred) | Postgres database name. Auto-set by Replit Postgres. | Same fallback as above. |
| `PGPORT` | — | Postgres port. | Defaults to `5432`. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Fallback | Full Postgres connection URI (e.g. `postgresql://user:pass@host/db`). Used only when `PGHOST` is **not** set. | If neither `PGHOST` nor `DATABASE_URL` is set, the pool cannot connect and the server will fail startup migrations. |

> **Precedence rule (from `lib/db/src/index.ts`):** When `PGHOST` is present, the pool is
> built from `PGHOST/PGUSER/PGPASSWORD/PGDATABASE/PGPORT`. `DATABASE_URL` is only read as
> a fallback when `PGHOST` is absent. On Replit, the platform always sets `PGHOST`, so
> `DATABASE_URL` is effectively unused in hosted environments.

### Required on first deploy only

| Variable | Description | Behaviour when unset |
|---|---|---|
| `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` | Email for the initial admin account, created only when the `users` table is empty. | No admin account is seeded — the app starts but no one can log in until an account is created manually. |
| `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Password for the bootstrap admin. Must be strong (≥ 12 chars). | Same as above. |

> **Security:** Remove `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from Replit
> Secrets after the first successful boot. The seed logic only runs when `users` is empty,
> but removing these variables is defence-in-depth.

### Optional — runtime behaviour

| Variable | Default | Description | Behaviour when unset |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` | Set to `production` on Replit Autoscale. Controls CORS strict-mode, SSL enforcement, and Postgres SSL. | CORS fails-open (allows all origins); Postgres connects without SSL; log output is pretty-printed. |
| `REPLIT_DOMAINS` | — | Comma-separated list of allowed CORS origins (e.g. `your-app.replit.app`). | In production without this var, CORS is restricted to `localhost` only — the deployed frontend cannot call the API. In development (no `NODE_ENV=production`), all origins are allowed. |
| `BASE_PATH` | `""` | Base URL prefix for invite and magic-link emails (e.g. `/api`). Used when constructing absolute URLs in auth emails. | Falls back to empty string; invite links use a relative path which works on Replit but may break in self-hosted setups. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Pino log level (`trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`). | Defaults to `info`. |

### Optional — features

| Variable | Default | Description | Behaviour when unset |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | OpenAI API key for the AI Copilot (`/api/ai/*`). | All AI endpoints return `setupRequired: true`. The rest of the app is unaffected. **Leave unset until the OpenAI DPA is signed.** |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | `gpt-4o` | OpenAI model used for AI Copilot calls. | Falls back to `gpt-4o`. |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | — | Sentry Data Source Name for error capture. | Sentry is disabled — the server starts normally. Get the DSN from **sentry.io → Project Settings → Client Keys**. |
| `SMTP_HOST` | — | SMTP server hostname (e.g. `smtp.sendgrid.net`). | OTP/invite emails cannot be sent. `/api/auth/smtp/status` returns `available: false`. Password login still works. |
| `SMTP_PORT` | `587` | SMTP port. `465` enables implicit TLS. | Defaults to `587` (STARTTLS). |
| `SMTP_USER` | — | SMTP username / sender address. Required if `SMTP_HOST` is set. | Nodemailer auth fails if `SMTP_HOST` is set but `SMTP_USER` is absent. |
| `SMTP_PASS` | — | SMTP password or API key. Required if `SMTP_HOST` is set. | Same as above. |
| `SMTP_FROM` | `SMTP_USER` | Display name + address for outbound email (e.g. `Ringside <noreply@example.com>`). | Falls back to the value of `SMTP_USER`. |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | — | OAuth 2.0 / OIDC client ID for SSO login. | SSO login routes return `501 Not Implemented`. Password and OTP login are unaffected. |
| `OIDC_ISSUER` | — | OIDC issuer URL (e.g. `https://accounts.google.com`). Required alongside `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`. | Same as above. |

### Test / CI only

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `TEST_EMAIL` | Email used by the Playwright E2E suite to log in. Falls back to the dev-seed value when unset. |
| `TEST_PASSWORD` | Password for the E2E suite. Falls back to the dev-seed value when unset. |

## Backup Worker (`artifacts/backup-worker`)

The backup worker runs as a separate process, writes nightly `pg_dump` snapshots to
Replit Object Storage, and retains the 14 most recent backups. It shares the same Postgres
and Sentry variables as the API server.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description | Behaviour when unset |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `PGHOST` | ✅ | — | Postgres hostname. | Worker crashes at startup (`Missing required env var: PGHOST`). |
| `PGUSER` | ✅ | — | Postgres username. | Worker crashes at startup. |
| `PGPASSWORD` | ✅ | — | Postgres password (passed to `pg_dump` via environment). | Worker crashes at startup. |
| `PGDATABASE` | ✅ | — | Postgres database name. | Worker crashes at startup. |
| `PGPORT` | — | `5432` | Postgres port. | Uses default. |
| `DEFAULT_OBJECT_STORAGE_BUCKET_ID` | ✅ | — | Replit Object Storage bucket ID where `.sql.gz` backups are written. Visible in the Replit `.replit` file. | Worker crashes at startup (`DEFAULT_OBJECT_STORAGE_BUCKET_ID is not set`). |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | — | — | Same Sentry DSN as the API server. | Backup failures are logged locally but not captured in Sentry. |

> Backups run every **6 hours** and are stored under `backups/db/` as
> `YYYY-MM-DDTHH.sql.gz`. Pruning keeps the 14 most recent files.

## Local development with Docker

Run the full stack (API server, Postgres, backup worker) on any machine that has Docker Desktop or Docker Engine + Compose v2.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Mac/Windows) or Docker Engine + Docker Compose v2 (Linux)
- `openssl` — to generate a secure `SESSION_SECRET`

### Setup

1. **Copy the env template:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Docker Compose automatically reads `.env` from the project root for variable substitution.

2. **Fill in the required values** (at minimum):

   | Variable | How to set |
   |---|---|
   | `SESSION_SECRET` | `openssl rand -hex 32` |
   | `PGPASSWORD` | Any local Postgres password (e.g. `changeme`) |
   | `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` | Email for the first admin account |
   | `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Strong password (≥ 12 chars) |

3. **Build and start:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   The API server is available at **http://localhost:8080** once Postgres is healthy.
   Schema migrations run automatically on first boot — no manual step needed.

4. **Subsequent starts** (after the first build):
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

### Services

| Service | Image / Build | Port | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `postgres` | `postgres:16-alpine` | 5432 | Persisted via the `postgres_data` named volume |
| `api` | `Dockerfile` (multi-stage) | 8080 | Starts after Postgres health check passes |
| `backup-worker` | `artifacts/backup-worker/Dockerfile` | — | Runs `pg_dump` every 6 hours — see note below |

### Postgres data persistence

Data lives in the `postgres_data` Docker volume. To reset the database:
```bash
docker compose down -v    # removes containers AND the volume
docker compose up --build
```

### Backup worker — GCS credentials

The backup worker uploads dumps to Google Cloud Storage. In production (Replit), it fetches credentials from a Replit-managed sidecar. **Outside Replit, one of the following is required:**

- Set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/run/secrets/gcs-key.json` in `.env` and mount the service account key file into the container, or
- Simply ignore the backup worker's error logs in local dev — the worker catches the error and retries every 6 hours without crashing the service.

For local dev, database backups are rarely needed; the Postgres data volume already persists across restarts.

### Running one-off commands inside the container

```bash
# Open a shell in the running API container
docker compose exec api sh

# Run a raw SQL query against Postgres
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d ringside -c "SELECT count(*) FROM targets;"
```

## Branch protection (GitHub — manual step for Rahul)

After the GitHub Actions CI workflows land (Task #305), enable the following on
`main` via **GitHub → Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules**:

- **Require status checks:** `verify`, `codeql`, `gitleaks`
- **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
- **Require at least 1 reviewer** (recommended)

Without branch protection, CI is advisory — PRs can merge with failing checks.
